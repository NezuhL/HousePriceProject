# House Price Prediction Project
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Training machine learning models such as Linear Regression.
- Evaluation of models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.
- Visualization of results and performance comparison between models.

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- PyCharm (for code development)
- MLflow

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an accurate predictive model for house prices, which can be used for future price estimation or real estate market analysis.
